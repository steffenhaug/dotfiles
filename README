how to bootstrap desktop environment:

- Install the Mate Desktop Environment as usual
    - Set up a GTK theme so all applications
      that use GTK look uniform
    - Configure your bar setup, and
      remember how wide they are
- Install your favorite terminal (i like Alacritty)
- Install your favorite text editor (i like VIM)
    - For my setup, you need to install junegunn/vim-plug
      manually to bootstrap
    - After that, just symlink the rc-file and run :PlugInstall

- Configure Alacritty
    - Change colorscheme to match vim
    - Change font to your favorite font
    - Install xclip if you wan to enable
      pasting from clipboard
    - Increase the line-spacing slightly if you want to

You need your terminal and text editor from here on,
so configure it now. For my setup:

- Install your favorite shell (i like ZSH)
    - Symlink env.zsh to $HOME/.zshenv
    - Symlink rc.zsh to $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc

- Install tmux
    - Just symlink the config file to $HOME/.tmux.conf
    (i don't think tmux actually respects XDG-config, unfortunately)



- Install bspwm and sxhkd
- Install a program launcher (like Rofi or dmenu)

- Set up Mate the way you want it
- Disable ALL Mate hotkeys
    - Control Center > Keyboard Shortcuts
    - Backspace to disable hotkey
- Configure sxhkd and bspwm
    - Symlink from dotfiles repo to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
